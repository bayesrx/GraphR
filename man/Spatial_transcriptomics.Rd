\description{
This data set was collected from biopsy of breast cancer at
a thickness of 16 \eqn{\mu}m whose locations can be classified into
three spatial regions as tumor, intermediate, and normal based on the
Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining image. The size of three regions are
114, 67, and 69 respectively. The data includes measurement of 100 spatially expressed
genes with the lowest Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) adjusted p-value by applying SPARK method
at 250 spot locations.
